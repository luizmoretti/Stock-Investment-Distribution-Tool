# Stock Investment Distribution Tool

This Python program retrieves the prices of a list of stocks provided by the user and helps distribute a specified amount of money to invest among these stocks.

## How the Code Works

```
Enter the stock codes you want to search for (separate by commas): KLBN4, TRPL4, BBDC4
```
5. The program will retrieve the prices for the stocks entered, and then ask you how many stocks you would like to buy from each company. Enter your response. For example:
```
How many stocks would you like to buy from each company? 10
```
6. The program will calculate the ideal investment to buy your specified number of stocks from each company, and display this amount.
